# AtliQ-Grands-Hospitality-Analysis
## Project Overview
AtliQ Grands, the owner of numerous five-star hotels throughout India, has been a prominent figure in the hospitality sector for two decades. Recent challenges stemming from competitive strategies and management decisions have led to a decline in market share and revenue within the luxury and business hotel segment. In response, the managing director of AtliQ Grands aims to implement "Business and Data Intelligence" as a strategic initiative to reclaim their market position and revenue. However, the company currently lacks an internal data analytics team capable of delivering these crucial insights.
